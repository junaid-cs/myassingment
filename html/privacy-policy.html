For example, we may ask you for information we already have, like your phone or email address.

Nevertheless, if you wish to do it on your own, you can: Log in to your account > go to account settings > update or change your user details. You can follow similar steps to terminate your account. Once we receive your account termination request, we will delete or deactivate your account and information from active databases. As mentioned earlier, we may retain some information for fraud prevention, troubleshooting problems, future investigations, enforcement of our legal terms and/or compliance with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Linking third-party websites </div>
<p>The services linking to third-party services, websites, or applications may contain advertisements from third parties with no affiliation with us and may link to other online platforms. We do not guarantee about the third parties and don't take liability for any kind of loss or damage caused by using such third-party sources and platforms. Even including a link towards a third-party platform does not imply any endorsement by us. In such cases, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of your data shared with third parties, including websites, applications, and other sites linked to the services. You are advised to review the policies of third-party platforms and contact them directly in case of confusion. </p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Cookies and related tracking technologies </div>
<p>We may use cookies or relevant tracking technologies, such as web beacons and pixels, to access and store data. Cookies are small data files placed on the computer or mobile when one visits a website. Using cookies and similar technologies, we aim to improve and personalise your user experience, enhance our services, and analyse website performance for marketing activities.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">List Of Cookies We Use </div>
<ul>
<li>Essential Cookies: Cookies that are useful for the system's functioning and improve core functionality, authentication, connection stability, security, and more. You can always block cookies on your system, which will likely affect how the websites function. </li>
<li>Analytics Cookies: These cookies help you to identify the popular pages and how visitors navigate the site. We use them to calculate visits, check traffic sources, and measure and improve our website's performance. </li>
<li>Marketing Cookies: Some third-party service providers and advertising partners manage advertising on other websites. These parties use cookies through our site in order to provide you with advertisements on other websites based on one's interests and preferences. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although it's highly unlikely to control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, you can turn off cookies to limit the use of specific features of a service.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">For how long do we store your data </div>
<p>We store your data as long as necessary for purposes we have discussed in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is permitted by law, like tax, accounting, and applicable legalities. When we no longer have legitimate requirements for your data, we either anonymise or delete information. In case of backup archives, we will securely store your data and isolate it from further processing until it is deleted completely.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Keeping your information safe</div>
<p>We have taken all the necessary measures and implemented the latest technological and organisational security norms and measures to ensure top-notch data security while processing. However, despite all our sincere effort to protect your personal information, no storage technology can guarantee complete security, so we won’t make unrealistic promises stating no hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised parties can break into our security system to collect, steal, access, modify your data. We do our best to protect your information from unsafe sources. Still, transmitting your data to and from our services should be at your own risk. You should only access our services and products within a safe environment.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Data collection from minors</div>
<p>We do not knowingly collect information or market our products and services to children under 18. When you use our services or products, we assume that you are 18 years of age or a guardian of a minor and consent to use our services. If we learn that a user is less than 18, the account is immediately deactivated, and we take the necessary measures to delete their personal data from our systems. If you know someone below 18 availing of our services or products, please notify us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#74171b1a0015170034190d1507071d131a19111a001c1118045a171b19"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e1828e8f95808295a18c9880929288868f8c848f9589848d91cf828e8c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We will take instant action. </p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Do-not-track features</div>
<p>Countless web browsers and many mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-not-track (DNT) feature in the system so the user can activate the signal according to their preference and not worry about being monitored or data processing. However, no standard technology has been finalised for recognising and implementing DNT signals on a larger scale. Due to this, we do not respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your preference. Despite so, if we adopt a standard for online tracking in the future, we will inform you about the practice and include it in our revised version of our privacy policy.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Cross-Border Transfers</div>
<p>We process your personal information both within and outside the country. Each country has different data processing laws, and we ensure we abide by legal measures to assure high privacy compliance.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Time for Reply and Solution</div>
<p>We will provide you with the necessary information and take action on your request related to your rights within one month of receiving the request. The duration is likely to increase by 15 more days in case of an overwhelming number of requests, complicated requests, or requests that require extensive action. Regardless, we will inform you beforehand of such an extension within one month of receiving the request and the reason for such delay.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Account Assessment for Customer Support</div>
<p>In special instances, like getting customer support, our support team may request your account access. In such circumstances, they will be able to see your personal data in your account. Please note that we always take users’ permission before accessing their accounts. However, if you don’t permit access, it will delay the process and affect the customer support provisions.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Notifications of Breach</div>
<p>Your providing personal data is entirely voluntary, meaning there's no obligation. Yet, personal information is necessary for creating a user account and availing of our services or using our products. If you refuse you provide information, you will be less likely to get access to all our service features.</p>
<p>In case of a data breach, we will keep you informed. We will notify the respective data protection agency without delay to minimise the possibility of high violations of your rights and data safety. We take the best measures to avert such risks.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Who is the personal data controller</div>
<p>A Solvemore LTD, a company incorporated under the laws of Cyprus with a registered office at Evi Building, Floor 2, Flat/Office 201, Kypranoros 13, 1061 Nicosia, Cyprus, will be the controller of your personal data.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">Upgrading privacy policy</div>
<p>Please note this policy is subject to change with the change of law. We update our Privacy Policy with regular technological updates. You will know our policy is updated with the "Revised" date listed at the top. In case of material changes in our policy, we will inform you with direct notifications. Thus, to continue to use our services or products, we encourage you to check this section frequently to stay updated with the latest changes to ensure high data security.</p>
<div class="font-weight-bold pb-2">How to contact us</div>
